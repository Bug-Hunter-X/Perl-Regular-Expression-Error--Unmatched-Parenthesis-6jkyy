This repository demonstrates a common error in Perl regular expressions: unmatched parentheses or other syntax errors.  The script `bug.pl` contains a regular expression with an error. The `bugSolution.pl` demonstrates how to fix the error and shows how to use proper error handling and debugging techniques to identify and correct the problem.  Always validate your regular expressions before using them in production code.
